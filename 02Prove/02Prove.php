                <h1>Long-Time Passion</h1>
                <p>One of my passions is table-top gaming, specifically, table-top roleplaying.
                    There are many table-top roleplaying games (TTRPGs) out there, and their popularity has grown significantly
                    in the past several years as they have entered mainstream pop culture.<br><br>
                    Perhaps the most popular and well recognized TTRPG is Dungeons & Dragons.
                    I've had experience with D&D for about 10 years now, and have been a Game Master for about 4.</p>
                <h1>The Basics</h1>
                <p>
                    TTRPGs are group games, which may or may not use dice, maps, boards, etc. Often,
                    a TTRPG will have several Players who roleplay as a character of their creation, such as
                    an Elven Ranger, while one person will be the Game Master (GM), who more or less
                    plays not a single character but the world with which the Player Characters (PCs) interact.<br><br>
                    The GM roleplays as the various non-player characters in the world, from the local barkeep to
                    the horde of vicious goblins, as well as describes the environments and other situations in
                    which the players may find themselves. Being either a Player or the GM is bunches of fun
                    and can be incredibly rewarding as you play together and build a fun gaming experience as a group.
